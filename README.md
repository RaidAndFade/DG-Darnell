# DiscordSelfBot
===================================
### What is DiscordSelfBot?:
###### Discord Selfbot is a project that was suggested to me by a friend. The point of this project is to have an automated bot on the same account as yours on the communication platform called ["Discord"](https://discordapp.com/).
===================================
### Todo: 
###### Todo can be found in a comment at the top of the main files in my projects. In this case it is selfbot.js.
###### Certain files may also have their own TODO lists at the top of the file.
===================================
### How to use:
1. Make a file called `UserPass.js` in the same directory as `Selfbot.js`

	```javascript 
	var DiscordClient = require('./discord.io.js');
	var bot = new DiscordClient({
		email: "<Your discord email>",
		password: "<Your discord password>"
	});
	exports.bot = bot;
	var Twitter = require('twitter');Twitter = new Twitter({consumer_key: '<twitter:conskey>',consumer_secret: '<twitter:consec>',access_token_key: '<twitter:accesskey>',access_token_secret: '<twitter:accessec>'});
	exports.twitter=Twitter;
	var mysql = require("mysql");mysql = mysql.createConnection({host:'<mysqldb:host>',user:'<mysqldb:user>',password:'<mysqldb:pass>',database:'<mysqldb:database'});mysql.connect();
	exports.mysql=mysql;
	```

	MYSQL and Twitter are only required for some modules.
	If you don't have a Twitter api account or a MYSQL database set the variable to null and the associated modules will simply shutdown on load.
2. Make sure you have nodejs installed...

	Install it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/) if you haven't already.
3. Run the file.

	```
	node Selfbot.js
	```
